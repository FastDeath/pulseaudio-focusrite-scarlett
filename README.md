# PulseAudio? ðŸ’ª Srsly?! ðŸ‘Š
Yes, I know. It's PulseAudio. Basically just cuz like every mildly user-friendly desktop Linux distro's got it installed out-of-the-box. Feel free to post an issue on how useless I am for not using JACK or at least ALSA ffs ðŸ™ƒ

# Contributing
Feel free to add similar channel remappings for different devices, just send me a PR ðŸ˜ƒ
